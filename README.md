## hi there, i'm savir
i'm a student at the university of toronto (st. george campus), planning to double major in computer science and math, with a stats minor.

my main interest is using math, algorithms, data analysis, and programming to understand financial markets, predict risk, and figure out where to invest. not super into building apps/websites anymore. i care more about modelling and optimization.

## stuff i've made
- [math contest repository](https://mathcontestrepository.pythonanywhere.com): a platform with 1,400+ problems (mostly amc/aime/cemc), 460+ registered users, 15+ hosted contests, and 100+ original problems written by me
- [clonio ai](https://clonioai.guessoword.com): ios app that turns people into ai chatbots from dms/texts. made it for fun, hit top 25 in us/canada/swiss app stores (productivity, paid) with 200+ downloads in week 1
- [volcano judge](https://volcanojudge.pythonanywhere.com): online judge for competitive programming. supports python 3 and c++, basic sandboxing
- [ccc solutions](https://github.com/savirsingh/ccc-solutions): repo of 600+ problems i solved in competitive programming
