Programming enthusiast, particularly algorithms & data structures.
I'm in grade 12 and plan to pursue computer science or a related field in university.

## Projects
Some cool closed-source projects I built include:
- [The Math Contest Repository](https://mathcontestrepository.pythonanywhere.com), a contest-hosting platform with 1,400+ problems (primarily from AMC/AIME and CEMC contests) and 400+ registered students. I've successfully hosted 14 math contests and authored 100+ original problems as of March 2025.
- [Clonio AI](https://clonioai.guessoword.com), an iOS app that can transform people into AI chatbots based on DM/text conversation history. At its peak, this application ranked among the top 25 apps on the US App Store for paid apps under the "Productivity" section. It attracted 200+ downloads in the first week alone.

Some fun open-source projects I built include:
- [Volcano Judge](https://github.com/savirsingh/volcano-judge): A competitive programming online judge/grader based on LeetCode and Codeforces. Supports Python 3 (with sandboxing) and C++.
- [CCC Solutions](https://github.com/savirsingh/ccc-solutions): I thoroughly enjoy competitive programming and solved 500+ problems during my sport programming journey. Most solutions are available in my repository.

You can find dozens of other projects, including hackathon submissions, on [my website](https://savirsingh.com/projects) or on my GitHub profile :)

## Experience
